<p><strong><h2>Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns:</h2></strong><em><h4> Implement a neural network in NumPy to predict bike rentals.</h4></em></p>
<br>
<p>A bit introduction of the project:</p>
<p>In this project, I have built a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, I have gained a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher-level tools such as PyTorch. I have also learnt how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!<p>
  <p>The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.</p>
